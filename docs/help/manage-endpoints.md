# Manage your Endpoints
{:tools}

To connect, upload objects and manage then, you need at least one working endpoint. Each endpoint can have multiple API Tokens. Those tokens can live infinitely or can have expiration date.

While you can upload objects and set specific properties on them via our Dashboard, you still need to use API Endpoints to take full control.

See your endpoints: [https://www.bitpaket.com/paket/api](https://www.bitpaket.com/paket/api)
