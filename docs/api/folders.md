# Create Folder in your Paket

To create folder within your paket is easy.

{:toc}

## Create

```http
POST /v2/create HTTP/1.1
Host: api.bitpaket.com
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>

{
	"folder": "/my_folder"
}
```

> **Attention!** `:folder` parameter can have nested folder such as `/folder/in/another/folder`. However, before nested folders created, base (one before) folder created first. We do not recursively create folders.

### Create folder recursively (Ensure Exists)

We have noticed that create endpoint should have the base folder exists. In this example we will create all folders **recursively**, nonethless base exists or not. This endpoint will return true on success along wiÅŸth last folder and false on failure.

> **Attention!** If all folders already exists or created, last folder object will return as :data.


```http
POST /v2/create HTTP/1.1
Host: api.bitpaket.com
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>

{
	"folder": "/my_folder/in/another/last_folder",
	"ensure": true
}
```

> **Attention!** `:ensure` parameter is optional and represents that all structure should be created. If already exists, nothing will happen but last folder object will return as success.

| Key      | Description                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `folder` | /dir/with/sub. **Root '/' is not allowed.**          |
| `ensure` | **Boolean**. true for recursively ensure dir exists. |  |
